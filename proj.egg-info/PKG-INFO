        - ``proj/``
        
          This is the main Django project.
        
          We have also added a ``proj/__main__.py`` that executes if you do
          ``python -m proj``, and it will work as the manage.py for the project.
        
          This is also installed by setup.py as an entry point, so after
          ``python setup.py install`` or ``python setup.py develop`` the
          ``proj`` command will be available::
        
                $ python setup.py develop
                $ proj runserver
        
            The above is the same as running ``manage.py runserver``, but it will
            be installed in the system path.
        
        - ``faustapp/``
        
            This is a Django App that defines the Faust app used by the project,
            and it also configures Faust using Django settings.
        
            This faustapp is also installed by setup.py as the ``proj-faust`` program,
            and can be used to start a Faust worker for your Django project by doing::
        
                $ python setup.py develop
                $ proj-faust worker -l info
        
        - ``accounts/``
        
            This is an example Django App with stream processors.
